# BurgerApp
This is a barebones application to demonstrate my ability to use handlebars to render a website, design a database schema, and implement an object relational model to perform basic database operations. The database stores burgers, and a button lets you 'eat' the burger (marks it as eaten in the database)

## Installation
Here are the steps for running this application locally on your machine:
1. Clone the repo to your local machine
2. cd into the directory
3. run "npm install" to install all the necessary packages
4. Add your local mysql server root password in the 'connection.js' file
5. run "node server.js" in the root directory to start the application.
6. browse to http://localhost:8080/

## Using the app
Burgers can be added using the submission box. Clicking the button next to a burger marks it as eaten. 

## Improvement opportunities
Style! Style style style. I did the most bare-bones styling I could due to time constraints, but this application could look a lot better with a little time.

This project is more of a proof of my ability to implement concepts than an actual functional application, but there's definitely more database operations I could perform (deletes, more complicate updates, etc).
